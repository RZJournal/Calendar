# Calendar

Created using prompt engineering. Testing the limits of GPT

Prompt 1: create a calendar app using flask 
Prompt 2: I want the app to have a calendar section where I can see all tasks, ability to add a task(have a popup where I can enter task information such as name, date, notes), I also want a turn on notification option
Prompt 3: After I add task, I don't see anything on the screen. I want a calendar on the screen even before adding tasks(it is blank at that point). Also I don't understand why the url changes to this: http://127.0.0.1:5000/?name=Math&date=2023-11-15
Prompt 4: doesn't work please use some different library
Prompt 5: I want more specific time like 9 oclock am and a section for notes because I may have math homework but I want to record details
